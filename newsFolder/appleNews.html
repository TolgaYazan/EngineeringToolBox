      <h1 class="section-main-title">iPad Air 5 (2022): Everything you need to know</h1>
      <div class="news-list-container">

          <h2 class="newspages" >2020 was a big year for the iPad Air, with the fourth-gen tablet offering a complete redesign, a boost in screen size and a price hike to match. Price increase aside, the iPad Air 4 offers a premium tablet experience with the same full-screen design as Apple’s iPad Pro range, and it’s the first Apple product to feature a Touch ID sensor within the Power button.

With such big changes on offer from the fourth generation tablet, what can we expect from the iPad Air 5? We break down all the rumours and expectations of the next-gen iPad Air right here.
          
          When will the new iPad Air be released?
While the iPhone and Apple Watch tend to get yearly updates, the same can’t be said of the iPad Air. In fact, compared to the rest of the current range, the iPad Air release history is fairly sporadic:

iPad Air (first gen): November 2013
iPad Air (second gen): October 2014
iPad Air (third gen): March 2018
iPad Air (fourth gen): October 2020
With that in mind, it looks unlikely that Apple will follow a yearly release cycle, so the chances of an iPad Air 5 appearing in 2021 have always been slim. Now that we're now in December 2021, it's almost certainly not making an appearance.  
         What’s more likely is a release sometime in 2022, with Ming-Chi Kuo indeed pointing a finger at a 2022 release for the new iPad Air. That’s backed up by a May 2021 ETNews report, also pointing towards a 2022 release date for an OLED-enabled iPad Air.

So, while you might be holding out hope for a new iPad Air in 2021, it looks like you might have to wait a little longer. If you can’t wait that long, take a look at our choice of the best iPads available right now.

Upgraded 3nm chipset
While it’s a given that the next iPad Air will feature a more powerful chipset, a Nikkei Asia report suggests that an iPad being released in 2022 could feature an upgraded 3nm chipset, with release expected in the latter half of the year.

While it’s probable that Apple will first launch the 3nm chipset on the iPad Pro, Apple tends to refresh its Pro tablet range in the first half of the year, leading to suggestions that the chipset could actually appear on the iPad Air first.

According to TSMC, 3nm technology offers a 10% to 15% increase in performance compared to a 5nm chipset like the A14 Bionic, while improving battery efficiency by 25% to 30%. Considering the impressive performance on offer from the current iPad Air, it’ll likely be an impressive performance jump – if there’s any truth to the claim, anyway.  

It could even beat the chipset of the 2022 iPhone range, with the same report suggesting it’ll sport an intermediary 4nm chipset.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggests that the iPad Air will likely feature either the A15 or A16 Bionic, and that the final decision could come down to chip availability as Apple has already cut back on iPad mini production as it was competing with the iPhone 13 on A15 chipsets.

<h2 class="newspages">Improvements to iPadOS
While we might not know much about the upgrades on offer from the next-gen iPad Air, we are confident that it’ll run iPadOS 15.

The latest iPad-focused update, released in September 2021, introduced a number of long-awaited features including the ability to place widgets anywhere on the home screen like you can on an iPhone. The widgets take advantage of the larger display too, packing more info on-screen than their iPhone counterparts.

App Library, another feature Apple introduced in iOS 14, also made its way to iPadOS 15. Accessible via a new icon in your dock, it provides an overview of all installed apps intelligently categorised into different folders.

There’s also an update to Swift Playgrounds, the app that teaches kids to code in Swift, with keen coders able to fully build, test and submit iPhone and iPad apps to the App Store from the iPad itself.
