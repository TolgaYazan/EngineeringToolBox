              <div class="news-card-location"><p class="news-card-content">We were spoiled with iPad updates in 2021, with new versions of the iPad, iPad mini and iPad Pro. But one name missing from the list was the iPad Air, which was last updated in 2020. It's overdue for some love in the year 2022.

That probably won't happen - join in if you know the words - until a spring event in March or April, both because of the greater publicity at a proper event and because the last iPad reveal was still relatively recent: if the Air was that close to readiness you'd have expected Apple to announce it alongside the new iPad mini and 10.2in iPad in September.


But, like the Mac mini, the new iPad Air is more likely to appear in January than it was in December, so there's some grounds for optimism. Want more information? Direct the browser of your choice to our regularly updated new iPad Air guide.

              <div class="news-card-location"><p class="news-card-content">In downtown Kuala Lumpur, Merdeka 118 topped out at 678.9 metres tall and 118 storeys, becoming the second-tallest building in the world. Five years after construction started, the tower’s final silhouette is revealed with the completion of the spire, redefining the city’s skyline currently dominated by the Petronas Towers and the Kuala Lumpur Tower. Designed by Australian firm Fender Katsalidis, the project features a triangular faceted glass façade inspired by patterns found in Malaysian art and, together with the surrounding park designed by Sasaki, creates a new layer of the city’s identity.

              <div class="news-card-location"><p class="news-card-content">Inspired by the natural dexterity of the human hand, a team of engineers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has created a reconfigurable hybrid robotics system that is able to grip a variety of objects: from the small, soft and delicate to the large, heavy and bulky. This technology is expected to impact a range of industries, involving food assembly, vertical farming and fast-moving consumer goods packaging, which will progressively automate more of their operations in the coming years.

Led by Associate Professor Raye Yeow from the NUS Department of Biomedical Engineering and the NUS Advanced Robotics Centre, the hybrid robotic grippers use soft, flexible 3D-printed fingers with a reconfigurable gripper base. The robotic innovation is now in the process of being brought to commercial partners under the team's start-up RoPlus (RO+), comprising NUS researchers Low Jin Huat, Khin Phone May, Chen Chao-Yu and undergraduate student Han Qian Qian.

              <div class="news-card-location"><p class="news-card-content">Officials with the Danish energy company Ørsted have announced that they have achieved first power on the Hornsea 2 project—a new windfarm off the coast of England in the North Sea. As part of their announcement, posted on the company's web page, officials noted that once the windfarm is fully operational, it will represent the largest windfarm in the world.

Hornsea 2, as its name implies, is the second segment of a four-segment project. Hornsea 1 became operational last year and is currently the largest offshore windfarm—with its 174 turbines, the farm has a capacity of 1.2-GW—enough to power over a million homes in the U.K.

Hornsea 2 was approved for construction back in 2016—it will feature 165 8-MW turbines made by Siemens, which will give it a capacity of 1.32 GW. The offshore substation and reactive stations have been installed and tested while construction continues on the turbines. The windfarm will be located approximately 90 kilometers off the coast of Grims, England, which is not far from Leeds and Sheffield. Once the windfarm is fully operational, it will deliver power to a substation at Killingholme.

The Model X crossover has room for up to seven. It’s also the most expensive Tesla, featuring the unique Falcon Wing doors. You have your pick of two sedans: the larger, more expensive Model S is a hot-rod: in our testing, we’ve measured zero-to-60-mph times as quick as 2.4 seconds. The smaller, less pricey Model 3 Performance isn’t far behind, shooting to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds. Although it’s still in the concept phase, the Tesla Roadster promises to bring incredible performance to a sleek sports car. The company has also revealed its wildly styled pickup truck, the Cybertruck.
